TEST API
========

API can :
    - Print TITLE (if any)
    - Print Description of the test (if any)
    - Print the result of the test function and if it returned OK or BAD and it's BAD Number

It needs :
    - A function with no arguments and that returns a integer
    - The return must be 0 for a test that ended correctly and any other number otherwise.
      That error number is printed.

To use just imá¹•ort the header tester.h. An example of usage is in the tester.c file.
